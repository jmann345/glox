# TODO: Add Lists + List comphrension
* Lox will call them Lists, but they are equivalent to slices or vectors
* For the time being, they will be untyped like the rest of the language
* Supports comprehension, for example:
    * `"[" expr "|" generator "," guard "]"`
    * `[x | x <- 1..100, x % 2 == 0]`
